== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I migrate my WordPress site to a new host? =

Install All-in-One WP Migration on your current site and click **Export**. The plugin creates a single `.wpress` file containing your entire WordPress site - database, media, themes, and plugins. Then install a fresh copy of WordPress on your new host, install the plugin there as well, and use the **Import** feature to upload the `.wpress` file. The plugin will migrate everything automatically, including updating all URL references and handling serialized data safely. You can migrate between any hosting providers - from shared hosting to dedicated servers.

Before you migrate, we recommend lowering your DNS TTL to 300 seconds at least 48 hours in advance, and keeping your old host active for 7–14 days as a safety net in case you need to roll back.

= How do I backup and restore my WordPress site? =

To create a backup, go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Export** and choose your backup destination - local download or cloud storage. The plugin creates a complete backup of your entire WordPress site in a single `.wpress` file. To restore a backup, go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Import** and upload or select your `.wpress` backup file. The plugin will restore your database, themes, plugins, and media files automatically. After restoring a backup, clear all caches and re-save your permalink settings under **Settings > Permalinks**.

For best results, use a hybrid backup strategy: cloud storage for automated daily backups and local copies for fast recovery. Follow the 3-2-1 rule - maintain three copies of your data across two different storage types, with one stored off-site.

= Can I migrate a WordPress multisite network? =

Yes. The [Multisite Extension](https://servmask.com/products) allows you to migrate an entire WordPress multisite network as a single `.wpress` file. You can also extract a single subsite - when you migrate a subsite, the plugin automatically converts table prefixes and reorganizes media file paths. Multisite migrations require special handling because the network uses shared database tables for users and per-site tables with unique prefixes. We recommend at least 512 MB of PHP memory for large multisite migrations.

= What if my backup file exceeds the upload size limit? =

If your server rejects a backup file as too large during import, you have several options. You can increase the PHP upload limit by adding `php_value upload_max_filesize 512M` and `php_value post_max_size 512M` to your `.htaccess` file, or set `client_max_body_size 512m` for Nginx servers. For sites that require unlimited upload size, the [Unlimited Extension](https://servmask.com/products) removes all file size restrictions set by your host.

= How do I migrate a WooCommerce store? =

You can migrate a WooCommerce store the same way you migrate any WordPress site - export on your current host and import on the new one. However, after you migrate a WooCommerce store, you should immediately verify that payment gateway API keys are configured correctly, update any webhook URLs to reference your new domain, and run a small real transaction to confirm checkout works end-to-end. We recommend enabling maintenance mode on your old server after DNS propagation to prevent split orders during the transition. See our full [WooCommerce migration guide](https://blog.servmask.com/woocommerce-migration-guide/) for detailed steps.

= Will my SEO rankings be affected when I migrate? =

If you migrate to the same domain on a new host, your SEO rankings should remain intact because All-in-One WP Migration preserves all your content, URLs, and metadata exactly as they were. If you migrate to a new domain, set up proper 301 redirects mapping every old URL to its new equivalent and use Google Search Console's "Change of Address" tool. A temporary ranking fluctuation of 10–20% in the first 1–2 weeks after a domain migration is normal. Keep your redirects active for at least one year. See our [SEO migration checklist](https://blog.servmask.com/wordpress-seo-migration-checklist/) for a complete guide to preserving your rankings when you migrate.

= How do I troubleshoot a failed migration or import? =

The most common issues after you migrate and their solutions:

* **White screen**: Enable `WP_DEBUG` in `wp-config.php` to see the actual error. Verify PHP version compatibility between your old and new servers.
* **Database connection error**: Check that `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_HOST` in `wp-config.php` match your new server's settings.
* **404 errors on all pages**: Re-save permalinks under **Settings > Permalinks** to regenerate rewrite rules.
* **Broken images**: Verify the `wp-content/uploads/` directory transferred completely with correct permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files).
* **Import stuck or frozen**: Increase PHP `max_execution_time` and `memory_limit`, or use WP-CLI to migrate from the command line: `wp ai1wm restore backup.wpress`.

For a comprehensive list of migration troubleshooting tips, see our [migration troubleshooting guide](https://blog.servmask.com/wordpress-migration-troubleshooting/).

= Can I migrate between different database types? =

Yes, All-in-One WP Migration supports cross-database migration between MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite. This is especially useful when you migrate sites to or from WordPress Playground, which uses SQLite. The plugin handles all database schema differences automatically - you simply export from one environment and import into the other.

= Can I automate my backups and migrations using WP-CLI? =

Yes. All-in-One WP Migration includes full WP-CLI support for command-line automation. Use `wp ai1wm backup` to create a backup and `wp ai1wm restore backup.wpress` to restore or migrate from a backup file. This is ideal for developers who need to migrate sites in automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, or scheduled backup scripts. Combined with cron jobs, WP-CLI lets you automate your entire backup strategy without touching the WordPress dashboard.
